## Questions

- please ask them! :)

## Exercise driven

## Can you read the docs?

## Yes!

## Reading docs = programming! :)

- [angular.io](https://angular.io/)
- [Angular 2 cheatsheet](https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/cheatsheet.html)
- [MDN Javascript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript) - Browser DOM - HTML, CSS
- [Foundation 6 sites](http://foundation.zurb.com/sites/docs/) for styling 

## Can you have the slides?

## Yes!

- repo/slides/index.html

## Should you help each other?

## Yes!

## If you finish early, explain to others

- teaching will really test your knowledge


## Is asking for help a good idea?

## Yes :)

- you can always check API docs at home
- big questions/doubts are good to ask while I'm in the room

## Are the exercises puzzles?

## No!

## If you don't know what to do, ask

- it's hard to follow exercises

## Is Angular 2 finished?

## No!

- release-candidate
- stuff still changes
- but: big concepts very stable

## e.g a few days ago

- :( for me

## Any questions before we start?

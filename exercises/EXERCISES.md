# Exercises

Here are our goals in the exercises today. They're intended to be chances to use what you've learned, not puzzles. If it's not clear what to do, ask me!

All Angular 2 work should be written in angular-2-exercise/app.

Run `npm start` to:

1. compile your code in `/app` on change
1. open a browser to a live-reloading page
1. if you don't see what you expect, right click and click 'Inspect'. Then open the console tab
